# FIM/MIM Service .NET Client Library
 [![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Lithnet.ResourceManagement.Client)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lithnet.ResourceManagement.Client/) 
 
The Lithnet FIM/MIM Service .NET client library is a nuget package that developers can add to their .NET projects to programtically interact with the Microsoft FIM/MIM service.

This library has a similar purpose to the [FIM 2010 Client](https://fim2010client.codeplex.com/), but abstracts away the peculiars of the web service implementation into a robust object model. The development of the FIM 2010 client was abandoned some time ago and unfortunately, the client suffers from a number of bugs and performance issues. This library is *not* intended to be a drop-in replacement for that library. It is a complete re-write with a new API and more approachable way of working with the objects in the FIM service.
